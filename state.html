			<h3>About the NAQT State Championship</h3>
			<p>The NAQT Oklahoma State Championship is an annual tournament held to determine the state
			 champion of pyramidal quizbowl in the state of Oklahoma. Held each year in February, the
			 tournament uses the final NAQT Invitational Series question set of the season, a set slightly
			 more difficult than most NAQT regular-season sets. [add some more stuff here]</p>
			<h3>Qualification</h3>
			<p>Teams are required to qualify to participate in the NAQT State Championship based on their
			 performance at prior events during the season. Qualifications can be earned in one of three
			 ways: winning a local regular-season tournament; earning enough qualification points; or
			 submitting an accepted wild card bid. Because the NAQT State Championship is intended to serve
			 as the championship for all of pyramidal quizbowl, all regular-season tournaments which use
			 pyramidal questions in the standard tossup-bonus format will be counted toward qualification,
			 even if those tournaments do not specifically use an NAQT question set.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Tier 1: Winning a Tournament</b></li>
				<p>Any team that wins a local, regular-season tournament using pyramidal tossup-bonus
				 questions will be awarded an automatic qualification to the NAQT State Championship. This
				 only includes tournaments held in the state of Oklahoma - winning a tournament in another
				 state or winning an online national tournament does not count toward qualification</p>
				<li><b>Tier 2: Qualification Points</b></li>
				<p>All teams that participate in qualifying events will be awarded points based on the
				 percentile of their finishing position. For example, in a field of 20 teams the winning team
				 will be awarded 100 points (and an automatic qualification), the second place team will
				 receive 95 points, the third place team will receive 90 points, and so on. The number of
				 points a team receives at a given tournament can be computed from the formula,
				 100 * (1 - <sup>p-1</sup>&frasl;<sub>n</sub>)
				 where <i>p</i> is the team's finishing position and <i>n</i> is the number of teams at the
				 event.</p>
				<li><b>Tier 3: Wildcard Bids</b></li>
				<p>Any team that is unable to qualify through one of the above methods may submit an
				 application for a wildcard bid. Teams will be required to submit their prospective roster for
				 the state championship, as well as links to stats which show why their application should
				 be accepted. The application for the 2025 State Championship will be opened near the end
				 of the first semester of the competition year.</p>
