        <p>For the 2025-2026 season, I am putting the schedule page on hiatus. Maintaining this page requires more active effort than I had originally anticipated due the the large number of tournaments which do not get scheduled until the middle of the year, and I cannot commit to being able to update it consistently throughout the year. The schedule of events for NAQT tournaments in the state of Oklahoma can be found at all at times on the <a href="https://www.naqt.com/schedule/?year_code=2025&audience_id=&length=Any&state_code=OK&radius=&center_description=&include_online=true">NAQT website</a>, and the schedule of events for OSSAA tournaments can be found <a href="https://ossaaillustrated.com/academic-bowl/">here</a>.</a></p>
