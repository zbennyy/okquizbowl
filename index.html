        <h3>Welcome to the online home of Oklahoma Quizbowl!</h3>
        <p>This website is intended to serve as the home of all things quizbowl in Oklahoma - information about upcoming tournaments, links to stats from previous events, qualification rankings for the NAQT State Championship, and more.</p>
        <p>As of now, this site is fairly bare-bones. More information and features are on the horizon, but development will likely be slow. Emphasis will be on updating pages with accurate information when new tournament announcements are made, results are posted, or when other important information becomes available.</p>

        <p>For questions or any other concerns, email <a href="mailto:zac@okquizbowl.com">zac@okquizbowl.com</a></p>
